# libre-office-tpl

This repository is place to find my LibreOffice templates.

# About

The document templates are not code. However, each commit corresponds
to an increment in the template.

# Contributing

Changes to the binary template are quite different from code.
Hence, I will **not** accept any changes to these templates.

You can, however, improve these templates for your own use.

# License

There is no code in this repository - so far.
